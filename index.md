## Prof Feynman's Messenger Series
Microsoft's Bill Gates got ownership of this series for a research project called [Project Tuva](microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/tuva-richard-feynman/) from the Cornell University.

Project Tuva has been discontinued and the website not maintained. But the lectures are pure gold - I thought it should be accessible to you. Please note that the content is still owned by Microsoft and hence will play on their Azure Player. 

1. [Law of Gravitation — An Example of Physical Law](ch01.md)
2. [The Relation of Mathematics and Physics](ch02.md)
3. [The Great Conservation Principles](ch03.md)
4. [Symmetry in Physical Law](ch04.md)
5. [The Distinction of the Past and Future](ch05.md)
6. [Probability and Uncertainty – The Quantum Mechanical View of Nature](ch06.md)
7. [Seeking New Laws](ch07.md)

### Enjoy!
